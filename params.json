It is based on [**Frida**](http://www.frida.re).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n-------------\r\nAppMon is a framework for monitoring and tampering system API calls of native apps on macOS, iOS, and android. You may also use it for security profiling of executable binaries on the above mentioned platforms. \r\n\r\nAppMon is my vision is to make become the Mac OS X/iOS/Android equivalent of the this project [**apimonitor**](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor) and [**GreaseMonkey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey). This should become a useful tool for the mobile penetration testers to validate the security issues report by a source code scanner and by inspecting the APIs in runtime and monitoring the app’s overall activity and focus on things that seem suspicious. You can also use pre-defined user-scripts to modify the app’s functionality/logic in the runtime e.g. spoofing the DeviceID, spoofing the GPS co-ordinates, faking In-App purchases, bypassing TouchID etc.\r\n\r\nIn the current release, we have the ability to hook both the Apple’s CoreFoundation API’s as well as the Objective-C methods (even if its done in a Swift app via the bridging header).\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nBeing a big fan of the Sysinternals Suite (acquired by Microsoft) and the recent spike in the number of mobile app releases we see an increase in Mobile app security assessments and the lack of toolset for doing it easily and thoroughly, easily, became the motivation for this idea. \r\n\r\nAnd as the tool matures, with time (i.e. as I get more spare time) we can have even more refinement as to add pattern detection into this monitoring where we can tag/classify the data (e.g. PII etc.) \r\n\r\nAPIs\r\n----------\r\n> **Categories:**\r\n> - Disk I/O (R/W)\r\n> - Network (HTTP GET, POST etc.)\r\n> - Crypto (HMAC, Hash function, block ciphers, X.509 certs etc.)\r\n> - XML/JSON\r\n> - KeyChain\r\n> - Database (e.g. SQLite)\r\n> - WebView\r\n> - UserDefaults (SharedPreferences equiv.) & more.\r\n\r\nIn the current release, we have the ability to hook both the Apple’s CoreFoundation API’s as well as the Objective-C methods (even if its done in a Swift app via the bridging header). Swift support is not yet available in frida-gum and hence we'll have to wait until then. All I want to from you all is to watch the Video Demo (link above), take a look at the source-code and then provide your feedbacks/comments/suggestions/rants. And also it would be really helpful if you can provide me and missing feature you would like to see in the tool.\r\n\r\nSetup & Install\r\n-----------------\r\n> Tested on:\r\n> - **Host**: MacOS X 10.11\r\n> - **Target Device**: iPhone 5S (iOS 8.1) _(other devices, OS is supported as long as Frida supports it)_\r\n\r\nSetup Host Environment\r\n```\r\n$ sudo -H pip install argparse frida flask termcolor dataset\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetup Target Device\r\n\r\n> - Follow the instructions to install Frida on the target device i.e. the iOS device, as mentioned in the [**Official Frida Docs**](http://www.frida.re/docs/ios/#with-jailbreak)\r\n> - Do the smoke-test as mentioned in the [**Official Frida Docs**](http://www.frida.re/docs/ios/#with-jailbreak) and make sure everything is working as expected.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n####AppMon Sniffer\r\n```\r\nusage: appmon.py [-h] [-a APP_NAME] [-p PLATFORM] [-s SCRIPT_PATH]\r\n                 [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-ls LIST_APPS] [-v]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help      show this help message and exit\r\n  -a APP_NAME     Process Name; Accepts \"Twitter\" for iOS;\r\n                  \"com.twitter.android\" for Android; \"Twitter\" for MacOS X\r\n  -p PLATFORM     Platform Type; Accepts \"ios\", \"android\" or \"mac\"\r\n  -s SCRIPT_PATH  Path to agent script file; Can be relative/absolute path for\r\n                  a file or directory; Multiple scripts in a directory shall\r\n                  be merged; Needs \"-a APP_NAME\"\r\n  -o OUTPUT_DIR   (Optional) Path to store any dumps/logs; Accepts\r\n                  relative/absolute paths\r\n  -ls LIST_APPS   Optional; Accepts 1 or 0; Lists running Apps on target\r\n                  device; Needs \"-p PLATFORM\"\r\n  -v              show program's version number and exit\r\n```\r\n-----\r\n####AppMon Intruder\r\n```\r\nusage: appintruder.py [-h] [-a APP_NAME] [-p PLATFORM] [-ls LIST_APPS]\r\n                      [-s SCRIPT_PATH] [-v]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help      show this help message and exit\r\n  -a APP_NAME     Process Identifier; Accepts \"Twitter\" for iOS;\r\n                  \"com.twitter.android\" for Android; \"Twitter\" for MacOS X\r\n  -p PLATFORM     Platform Type; Accepts \"ios\", \"android\" or \"mac\"\r\n  -ls LIST_APPS   Optional; Accepts 1 or 0; Lists running Apps on target\r\n                  device; Needs \"-p PLATFORM\"\r\n  -s SCRIPT_PATH  Path to agent script file; Can be relative/absolute path for\r\n                  a file or directory; Multiple scripts in a directory shall\r\n                  be merged; Needs \"-a APP_NAME\"\r\n  -v              show program's version number and exit\r\n```\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot#1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpnishant/appmon/master/screenshots/1.png?raw=true \"Screenshot#1\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot#2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpnishant/appmon/master/screenshots/2.png?raw=true \"Screenshot#2\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot#3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpnishant/appmon/master/screenshots/3.png?raw=true \"Screenshot#3\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot#4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dpnishant/appmon/master/screenshots/4.png?raw=true \"Screenshot#4\")\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo(s)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n###TouchID Bypass using AppMon Intruder\r\n\r\n[![TouchID Bypass using AppMon Intruder](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ECnkgz3jnPM/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ECnkgz3jnPM)\r\n",
