Welcome to AppMon!
==================
As seen at [![](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/arsenal/2016.svg)](https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/arsenal.html#appmon)

Appmon is a runtime security testing & profiling framework for native apps on macOS, iOS & android and it is built using [**Frida**](http://www.frida.re).

This project was only possible because of **Ole André Vadla Ravnås** and I dedicate it to him. Follow him on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/oleavr), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/oleavr)
