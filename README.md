Welcome to AppMon!
==================


AppMon is an automated framework for monitoring and tampering system API calls of native macOS, iOS and android apps. It is based on [**Frida**](http://www.frida.re).

This project was only possible because of **Ole André Vadla Ravnås** and I dedicate it to him. Follow him on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/oleavr), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/oleavr)
