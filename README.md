Welcome to AppMon!
==================

This project was only possible because of **Ole André Vadla Ravnås** and I dedicate it to him.

Follow him on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/oleavr), [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/oleavr)

_TL;DR_
AppMon is an automated framework for monitoring and tampering system API calls of native iOS and Android apps (upcoming). It is based on [**Frida**](http://www.frida.re). You may call it the [**GreaseMonkey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) for native mobile apps. ;-)
